        <p>Hi! My name is Ben Elsom and this is my first website. Please take a look around.</p>

        <p>After completing grade 12 I began work full time immediately as an administration  assistant at <a href="https://smsfparaplanners.com.au/" target="_blank"> SMSF Paraplanners </a>, a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paraplanning.asp" target="_blank"> paraplanning </a> practice. I also began my study to complete my Diploma of Financial planning which I completed in early 2020. 

            After I completed my diploma I decided to dip my toe into the world of university and started an economics course at university which I achieved a HD in. 
            
            After 3 years full time with SMSF Paraplanners I knew it was time to move onto something new, which is when I found Coder Academy. If you wish to read a more in-depth version of my work and study history please refer to my resume   </p>
